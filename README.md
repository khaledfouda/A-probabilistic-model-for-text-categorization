<b>Abstract</b>  

Classifying social media content has been the interest of researchers during the last decade.
This paper proposes a probabilistic representation of topic-related keywords on social media.
We aim to estimate the conditional likelihood of a class given a short text like a tweet.
We used Reddit as a case study with an interest in identifying political content.
We reported the performance and compared it to machine learning methods.
Our model achieves a precision of 97% and takes only a few seconds to fit over 500,000 data points.
